    p CompSoc returns with ShefJam V &mdash; our 30-hour game jam.

    p For the newcomers, what is a Game Jam? #[br]

    p Game jams are a great way to get experience programming for fun in a team or on your own. It's an event where you create a game based on a theme. That's it. How you go about it is up to you.

    p You can use any tools you want (see list of recommended resources below) and at the end, the games will be judged, and category winners crowned!

    p Meals and snacks will be provided during the event and prizes will be awarded to teams who produce creative and engaging games!

    p Tickets are free for #[a(href="/membership") society members] and only Â£3 for non-members.
