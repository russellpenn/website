      section.faq
        h2 FAQ
        h3 Do I have to be a member of the Computer Science Society?
        p Non-members can come as well, but non-members tickets are slightly more expensive.

        h3 What do I need to bring?
        p You'll need to bring a laptop (and its charger), with all the tools you need installed. You can also bring graphics tablets, small midi controllers, and some cold drinks and snacks.

        h3 I can’t program.
        p You don’t have to! You could team up with someone who can program, and your strengths in other fields, such as music or graphics can improve the game. There are also some free game engines which require very little programming knowledge, such as Construct 2 and GameMaker: Studio.

        h3 I’ve never made a game before.
        p Make one now! Start with something simple, there a lots of tutorials available for any game engine or library you choose, see our recommendations list below.

        h3 I’m a Hallam Student / UoS Alumni / Non-Student, can I come?
        p Yes you can! You will have to buy a non-members ticket, which will cost a bit more.

        h3 I don’t have any / enough team members, what should I do?
        p You can contact others on our Slack channel, or talk to people on the day of the event to team up. Alternatively you could enter solo, we have given awards to soloists in the past..

        h3 What happens to our games after the jam?
        p You retain full ownership of whatever you create. We can host it for you or if you make it public (on Github, etc.), we will publicise it on our site.

        h3 How many team members can we have?
        p There is no limit. However, smaller teams make management easier. We can only award up to 5 prizes per team.

      section.rules
        h2 Rules
        p We will be following fairly standard game jam rules, which are designed to inspire creativity:
        ul
          li #[strong You can use any tools you want], including proprietary and custom made ones. You could even make your own level editor to prepare for the jam.
          li #[strong Premade assets (graphics, music, etc.) can be used, provided they are openly available.] You must declare that you used them and you won't be eligible for prizes related to fields which you used assets for. (For example, you won't be eligible for the graphics prize if you used an open 3D model.) We encourage you to make your own assets if you can, even if they don't look like they're from a AAA game.
          li #[strong Any code used in the game that was not written during the jam must be publicly available], for example, libraries such as OpenFL and LWJGL are allowed.
          li #[strong The theme should be followed], but does not need to be followed strictly. Try to find a unique interpretation of the theme if you can.
          li Due to prize limitations, #[strong only up to 5 prizes will be available for each category], so if your team has more than 5 members, you will have to split the prizes between yourselves.
